# What I learn today
[Leetcode.704 Binary search](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/)

        
        // step 1 define the window left and right of binary search

        // step 2 define middle value for target to be compared with

        // step 3 write a while loop to keep checking with existing code


            //step 4a if middle is smaller then target. target at right

            //step 4b if middle is greater then targer. target at left

            //step 4c middle is target

        // step 5 target not found, return -1

[Leetcode.27 Remove Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-element/)

Thought process

	1. Set two pointer, one is for inserting, one is checking
	2. If the checking is not the same as element to remove, we insert the element with the currently checking element
         a.This implied that all the element to remove will be ignored by checking!
